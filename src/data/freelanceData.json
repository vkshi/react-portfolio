      "description": "Towards the end of my senior year, I started my first portfolio website. Back then, I was used to making multiple HTML files and linking them together as static pages. As you can see, I also got really excited when I discovered iframes, which was heavily featured in this old website. What I'm most proud of in this old website is the sidebar, since it uses JavaScript to expand and retract.",

I wanted to play with the concepts of the organic and the man-made. Stopmotion is definitely one of the most difficult media with which I've ever worked. Besides the sheer amount of photos it takes, keeping the light steady was nearly impossible to do in the dining room!",

It took me a few tries to get it right (you can see the earlier versions in the PDF), but she was very satisfied with the final product. This was also a great masking practice, especially when I decided to make the trees various different colors.",

After some research on the Chinese zodiac, I found that Daisy's birthday was a nice detailed nod towards her ethnicity. 1988 was the year of the earth dragon and Daisy's superpowers allows her to gather vibrations and form earthquakes (hence her codename: Quake). I enjoyed this project thoroughly as I got to design something both aesthetically pleasing and meaningful.",

Since I wanted the photoset to have bleak feeling to it, I had to learn how to desaturize each screencap so that the color profile all resembled each other. Nowadays, I'm a pro at all the coloring tools Photoshop has to offer. As you can see, I also had fun picking and styling the typeface for this piece.",
