In this project, my main role was writing the CSS code needed for the frontend styling to make sure everything was pixel perfect. This included writing the grid structure, the hover behaviors, and transition animations. As the company had a library of icons to work from, I also used React to import data and switch between the states of certain elements. The goal of this part is to redesign the sidebar so that it was less of a list and more in line with industory standards. We also wanted the navigation to be clearer as the previous sidebar did not provide a lot of information. Click the button below to see a comparison between the new and old designs.",

As the company had a library of icons to work from, I also used React to import data and switch between the states of certain elements. The goal of this modal is to provide a wholistic view of all the features Moesif's application offers. Each button has a hover behavior that corresponds with a brief summary of what the feature provides, along with a unique image. One of the bugs I worked on with this project was making sure that none of the invisible boundaries of the buttons overlapped so that image flickering did not occur when hovering between buttons. My code was then used as template for other similar modal throughout the application. Click the button below to see the modal design and behavior in a screencap.",

Using premiere, I cut out filler words (such as ahhs and umms), long pauses, and repeated imformation. Then in After Effects, I added colorful backgrounds, the spinning cogs, text, and subtitles. This was my first time captioning any video and I definitely learned a lot, including how tedious subtitling can be! Afterwards, I combined all the short clips into one long video and created a splash screen as well as insert screens. The idea was to have both short clips so that they could be used as video ads, and the long video so that viewers can watch the full conference between the two speakers.",
