      "description": "I was always most interested in courses focused on pop culture in the visual studies field as I feel that this is the kind of media we consume the most. Pop culture is how visual studies as a field connects to the present, as the theories in this field of study do not always have to apply to old paintings. This project also allowed me to explore the recent increase of abuse towards diaspora Asians (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) with the history of violence that the Asian diaspora in the West has endured. Visual media does influence our biases, especially when humans are such visual creatures, which is why examining different Asian stereotypes and tropes was the focus of my senior project.",

      "skills": "Figma, UI Research",
      "description": "This was the most challeging project of DSGN 234, a course on web apps. The task was to come up with an app concept, design it, then model its functionality with Figma. I wanted to create an app that would cater to audiences of color so that they can discuss representation in media, as that is something in which I have a lot of interest. After much consideration, my resulting product was something of a combination between a forum and a dictionary. I wanted to allow users to be able to comment on media and learn about stereotypes/tropes that are frequently applied to certain racial groups in the same app.",

I chose to emphasize my racial identity and explore how that affects the other facets of my life and/or intersects my other identities. I also wanted to use a bold yellow color scheme. As much as I like to deny it, the color yellow is a part of the East Asian American identity. But instead of it having negative connotations, I wanted to turn it into something that adds warmth and defiance to my identity.",

      "description": "This is the first part of the larger design project that I accomplished in this class. The idea was to choose an existing or future art biennial and create an identity for the event. I picked the Glasgow International Biennial because its theme for 2020 (postponed) was Attention, which inspired me to use neon colors. Before I decided neon signs with QR codes were probably more eye-catching than regular posters, I had drafted some that were more traditional-looking. I also learned a lot about masking and making photorealistic mockups with this project.",

The idea was to choose an existing or future art biennial and create an identity for the event. For the motion part of this project, I wanted to create something that had a social media feel to it. I made these videos square-shaped reminiscent of Instagram. They are meant to be eyegrabbing, but quickly and easily understood. To accomplish that, I focused on bright colors, a recognizable pattern (the neon tartan I created), and smooth transitions. My professor suggested adding audio to tie everything together, so I found a track that features electric bagpipes.",

The idea was to choose an existing or future art biennial and create an identity for the event. For the print media, I was thinking more pamphlet than book with a clean layout. I struggled a bit to balance the information on the pages; I didn't want the layout to be overcrowded. I also relied on the neon tartan pattern and neon colors to tie it back to the overarching identity.",

The idea was to choose an existing or future art biennial and create an identity for the event. Since the last part of this project was a website design, I wanted to tie it back to the posters I made in the first step. The idea is that once people scan the QR code on those posters, they would lead to this website. They can explore the website at their leisure, which would provide all the necessary information about the biennial. Below was my first sketch of the webpage design, to which my professor commented that it seemed to be very motion-driven. In my final design, I tried to lessen that aspect.",

For my project, I wanted to compare several things. First, I was interested in the poverty levels of difference districts in Philadelphia. Second, I wanted to compare locations of gun violence to see if they were more frequent or not in areas of high poverty. Last, I also wanted to see if there was a strong correlation between fatalities resulting from gun violence and the racial identities of the victims.",

There were several parts of this project, from pitching services to designing logos to determining typefaces. The professor stressed the importance of maintaining a cohensive theme for every element of the proposed service. Since my group decide to brand a bookbinding atelier, we focused our design around the Mrs Smith typeface, which is a derivative from the well-known Baskerville typeface. Our reasoning for this was to invoke a modern twist to the established and well-loved art of handbinding books.",
